# Detecting-Fine-Motor-Deficit-in-ASD-using-Motor-Parameters

- The aim of this study was to determine if patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have syndrome-specific motor deficits. 
  The proposed application uses machine learning classifiers to detect autistic symptoms based on motor parameters. 
  It also indicates the type and severity of fine motor deficit in the patient with ASD.
  
- The system uses motor parameters which represent activities in the application and the Autistic patient is made to perform the activities. 
  Based on the results of each activity a final report is generated. We also find it beneficial to observe motor development in Autistic patients 
  because it can be measured over time and results of testing can be easily reproduced.
